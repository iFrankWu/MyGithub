/**
 * A {@link ThumbnailMaker} which resizes an image to a specified dimension
 * when producing a thumbnail.
 * <p>
 * Optionally, if the aspect ratio of the thumbnail is to be maintained the same
 * as the original image (by calling the {@link #keepAspectRatio(boolean)} 
 * method with the value {@code true}), then the dimensions specified by the
 * {@link #size(int, int)} method, {@link #FixedSizeThumbnailMaker(int, int)} or
 * {@link #FixedSizeThumbnailMaker(int, int, boolean)} constructor will be used
 * as the maximum constraint of dimensions of the thumbnail.
 * <p>
 * In other words, when the aspect ratio is to be kept constant, then
 * thumbnails which are created will be sized to fit inside the dimensions
 * specified by the size parameter. 
 * <p>
 * <DL>
 * <DT><B>Usage:</B></DT>
 * <DD>
 * The following example demonstrates how to create a thumbnail which fits
 * within 200 pixels by 200 pixels, while preserving the aspect ratio of the
 * source image:
 * <pre>
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new File("sourceImage.jpg"));

BufferedImage thumbnail = new FixedSizeThumbnailMaker()
        .size(200, 200)
        .keepAspectRatio(true)
        .make(img);
